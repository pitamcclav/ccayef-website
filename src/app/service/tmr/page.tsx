                      <h2>Background</h2>
                      <p>
                          Premarital pregnancy is considered a taboo in Ugandan families, leading to mistreatment and
                          abuse of many young
                          girls after getting pregnant. In Mukono district, most pregnant teenage girls face
                          stigmatization, abandonment,
                          and rejection by their families. This often forces them into abortions, school dropout, early
                          marriages, and lifelong
                          poverty, including child labor, abuse, and neglect. Over 600 girls have benefited from this
                          rehabilitation program.
                      </p>

                      <h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
                      <p>
                          The Early Pregnancy Prevention and Teenage Mother Rehabilitation program is a key focus of the
                          Child Care and
                          Youth Empowerment Foundation (CCAYEF). Its aim is to provide child mothers with quality
                          antenatal care, safe deliveries,
                          postnatal care, breastfeeding skills, and rehabilitation to prevent second unwanted
                          pregnancies and promote self-reliance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          The program began in 2010 with just three girls, after it was discovered that teenage
                          pregnancy was not considered a
                          significant issue in both rural and urban communities in Mukono District. However, it
                          accounted for 24% of all pregnancies
                          reported in Mukono District hospitals, according to a CCAYEF survey (2009-2011). To date, 624
                          girls have been reached
                          through collaboration with Mukono Health Center IV and various caretakers. CCAYEF offers
                          counseling, home visits, emergency
                          material and medical support, cognitive restructuring classes, and re-integration into formal
                          education and vocational skills training.

                                      Premarital pregnancy is highly stigmatized in Ugandan families, leading to
                                      rejection, abandonment, and abuse of young pregnant
                                      girls, particularly in Mukono district. Many are compelled to drop out of school,
                                      undergo abortions, or enter into forced marriages,
                                      further exacerbating their vulnerability.
                                  </p>

                                      Children of teenage mothers also face severe hardships, often lacking financial
                                      support, parental care, and education opportunities.
                                      Many of them experience a vicious cycle of child motherhood, juvenile delinquency,
                                      malnutrition, and chronic poverty. The program aims
                                      to break this cycle by supporting young mothers and their children with a
                                      comprehensive rehabilitation approach.

                      <h2>1.7 Recruitment and Assessment of Teenage Mothers</h2>
                      <p>
                          The recruitment process assesses the vulnerability of teenage mothers to tailor appropriate
                          interventions during their rehabilitation. This process is carried out five days a week at
                          Mukono Health Centre IV.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Psychosocial support aims to empower young mothers emotionally and help them regain a normal,
                          focused life. Home visits help strengthen relationships with caretakers, assess the
                          socio-economic environment, and evaluate the young mother&#39;s vulnerability and parental
                          support.
                      </p>

                      <h2>1.9 Cognitive Restructuring and Life Skills Training</h2>
                      <p>
                          Life skills training equips young mothers with essential skills and knowledge to manage their
                          new responsibilities as young parents while coping with the daily challenges they face.
                      </p>

                      <h2>2.0 Advocacy</h2>
                      <p>
                          The program advocates for an end to teenage pregnancies and child marriages in Mukono District
                          through sensitization and community dialogue meetings.
                      </p>

                      <h2>2.1 Re-integration into Formal Education</h2>
                      <p>
                          We have re-integrated over 15 teenage mothers into formal education. One young mother has
                          completed nursery teacher training and is now employed, while others are in primary and
                          secondary schools. These mothers are setting life goals, and we support them through
                          consistent follow-ups, counseling, and training.
