                      <h3>Adolescent Health & Empowerment</h3>
                  </div>
                  <div className="container late">
                      <h2>Background</h2>
                      <p>
                          Our priority is to provide adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) information and
                          services to both in- and
                          out-of-school youth, aimed at preventing teenage pregnancies, HIV, and other STDs. Our
                          interventions focus on empowering
                          adolescents with the knowledge, tools, and support they need to make informed decisions
                          regarding their health and well-being.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Provision of ASRH Information and Services</h2>
                      <p>
                          We design and deliver appropriate ASRH information and services for adolescents through peer
                          health clubs and integrated
                          community outreaches. Our integrated approach brings together all stakeholders in adolescents&#39;
                          lives, working collaboratively
                          to achieve a common goal.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Peer Health Clubs</h3>
                      <p>
                          To create sustainable interventions among in-school youth, peer-to-peer health clubs have been
                          established and
                          monitored in eight secondary schools within Mukono District. These clubs equip students with
                          the knowledge to inform
                          and support their peers on growth and development challenges. Every year, four clubs
                          consisting of at least 25 peer
                          counselors each are formed, trained, and supported. CCAYEF staff provides ongoing mentorship,
                          ASRH information, and
                          peer-education materials to help students manage both their physical and emotional issues.
                          Club members receive peer
                          counseling training, enabling them to either provide direct support or make referrals for more
                          complex cases.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Integrated Community Outreaches</h3>
                      <p>
                          We host quarterly youth-oriented dialogue meetings covering various ASRH topics to provide
                          accurate information and
                          dispel common misconceptions. These outreaches, conducted in collaboration with health
                          workers, local community organizations,
                          and government offices, offer services like the distribution of Information Education
                          Communication (IEC) materials, HIV
                          counseling and testing, STI screening and treatment, and referrals.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Prevention of Teenage Pregnancies</h2>
                      <p>
                          Ugandaâ€™s teenage pregnancy rate stands at 25%, contributing to a high maternal mortality rate
                          of 438 per 100,000 live births.
                          Many survivors of teenage pregnancy face lifelong physical and psychological challenges. At
                          CCAYEF, we focus all of our programs
                          on preventing teenage pregnancies. Our mitigation measures include counseling, education, and
                          skills training to prevent subsequent pregnancies.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Cognitive Restructuring Classes for Pregnant Teenagers</h3>
                      <p>
                          These classes focus on the rehabilitation of pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers, many
                          of whom face trauma and uncertainty.
                          Routine one-on-one counseling and cross-cutting sessions on life skills, business skills, and
                          health education are provided to help
                          these young mothers cope with their new responsibilities. Each year, over 150 teen mothers
                          benefit from these programs.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Pre-adolescent Counseling in Primary Schools</h3>
                      <p>
                          In collaboration with the Mukono District Education sector and primary school administrators,
                          we engage vulnerable girls in
                          discussions about adolescence and its challenges. We also train teachers in adolescent
                          counseling and ASRH to ensure sustainability
                          and give students access to trusted adults with accurate information about their development.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Vocational Skills Training for Teenage Mothers</h3>
                      <p>
                          After rehabilitation, we encourage teen mothers to either return to school or acquire
                          vocational skills. These skills
                          trainings are provided at CCAYEF premises and, in some cases, girls are linked to other
                          training centers to ensure they gain the
                          socioeconomic tools needed to achieve self-sufficiency and prevent subsequent pregnancies.
