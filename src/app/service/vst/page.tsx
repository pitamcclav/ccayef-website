                      <h2>Background</h2>
                      <p>
                          This initiative is designed to equip teenage mothers and vulnerable young women with various
                          vocational
                          skills to help them achieve economic independence and become better parents. Participants can
                          choose from
                          a wide range of skills, including flower arrangement and decoration, tailoring and fashion
                          design, hairdressing,
                          making re-usable sanitary pads, liquid soap, and hair shampoo. The goal is to empower these
                          young women to support
                          themselves and their children.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          The vocational skills courses are offered over periods ranging from two months to one year.
                          Youth from all backgrounds
                          are taught a variety of income-generating skills. Classes are held at the CCAYEF offices,
                          where all materials and supplies
                          remain on-site at the training center.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Teenage mothers and pregnant teens enrolled in the life skills courses under the maternal
                          health division are encouraged to
                          return to school or enroll in the vocational skills program after delivery, ensuring they can
                          support their babies and gain
                          financial independence. CCAYEF helps subsidize the cost of these programs for vulnerable
                          youth, just as it supports school fees
                          for mothers who choose to return to education.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          In addition to courses at the CCAYEF training center, our staff also partner with community
                          groups to offer training in making Re-Usable Menstrual Pads (RUMPs), sewing bags, and soap
                          making. These groups include community womenâ€™s groups, primary school pupils, and teachers in
                          Mukono District.
                      </p>
