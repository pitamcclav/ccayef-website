                              Child Care And Youth Empowerment Foundation (CCAYEF) is a non-profit charitable
                              organization that was established in 2008.

                              The organization was founded by a three of individuals who were passionate about the
                              welfare of children and young people in Uganda being nurtured holistically to
                              realize their full growth and development potential.
                              The founders of CCAYEF recognized the need to provide support and resources to children
                              and young people who were vulnerable and marginalized.
                              The organization was established with the aim of empowering children and young people to
                              reach their full potential and lead healthy and fulfilling lives.
                              Since its establishment, CCAYEF has been working to provide early childhood development
                              through education, healthcare service, and other essential services to
                              children and young people in Uganda.
                              The organization has also been working to raise awareness about the rights of children and
                              young people and to advocate for their rights including Gender Based Violence.
                              CCAYEF is committed to making a positive impact in the lives of children and young people
                              in Uganda and to creating a better future for them.
